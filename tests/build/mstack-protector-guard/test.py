"""Check for mstack-protector-guard=global when targeting old x86 targets.

https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2015-11/msg00060.html changed the default for this
from using a global to using the TLS slot. As noted in
https://github.com/android-ndk/ndk/issues/297 (and in that commit), this is not
compatible with pre-4.2 devices, so we need to guard against that in the NDK.
