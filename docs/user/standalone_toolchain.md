Standalone Toolchains
=====================

[TOC]

You can use the toolchains provided with the Android NDK independently or as
plug-ins with an existing IDE. This flexibility can be useful if you already
have your own build system, and only need the ability to invoke the
cross-compiler in order to add support to Android for it.

A typical use case is invoking the configure script of an open-source library
that expects a cross-compiler in the `CC` environment variable.

Note: This page assumes significant understanding of compiling, linking, and
low-level architecture. In addition, the techniques it describes are unnecessary
for most use cases. In most cases, we recommend that you forego using a
standalone toolchain, and instead stick to the NDK build system.

Selecting Your Toolchain
------------------------

Before anything else, you need to decide which processor architecture your
standalone toolchain is going to target. Each architecture corresponds to a
different toolchain name, as Table 1 shows.

**Table 1.** Toolchain names for different instruction sets.

| Architecture | Toolchain name                         |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| ARM-based    | `arm-linux-androideabi-<gcc-version>`  |
| x86-based    | `x86-<gcc-version>`                    |
| MIPS-based   | `mipsel-linux-android-<gcc-version>`   |
| ARM64-based  | `aarch64-linux-android-<gcc-version>`  |
| X86-64-based | `x86_64-<gcc-version>`                 |
| MIPS64-based | `mips64el-linux-android-<gcc-version>` |

Selecting Your Sysroot
----------------------

The next thing you need to do is define your sysroot. A sysroot is a directory
containing the system headers and libraries for your target. To define the
sysroot, you must must know the Android API level you want to target for native
support; available native APIs vary by Android API level.

Native APIs for the respective [Android API levels] reside under
`$NDK/platforms/`; each API-level directory, in turn, contains subdirectories
for the various CPUs and architectures.

For more detail about the Android API levels and the respective native APIs they
support, see [Native APIs](stable_apis.html).

Creating the Toolchain
----------------------

The NDK provides the `make_standalone_toolchain.py` script to allow you to
perform a customized toolchain installation from the command line.

This is a new tool that replaces the old `make-standalone-toolchain.sh`. It has
been reimplented in Python so that Windows users will not need to install Cygwin
or MSys to take advantage of this tool.

The script is located in the `$NDK/build/tools/` directory, where `$NDK` is the
installation root for the NDK.

An example of the use of this script appears below:

```bash
$NDK/build/tools/make_standalone_toolchain.py \
    --arch arm --api 21 --install-dir /tmp/my-android-toolchain
```

This command creates a directory named `/tmp/my-android-toolchain/`, containing
a copy of the `android-21/arch-arm` sysroot, and of the toolchain binaries for a
32-bit ARM architecture.

Note that the toolchain binaries do not depend on or contain host-specific
paths. In other words, you can install them in any location or even move them if
you need to.

The `--arch` argument is required, but the STL will default to gnustl and the
API level will be set to the minimum supported level for the given architecture
(currently 9 for 32-bit architectures and 21 for 64-bit architectures) if not
explicitly stated.

Unlike the old tool, Clang is always copied into the toolchain. Every standalone
toolchain is useable for both Clang and GCC. For more information about Clang,
see [Clang's website](http://clang.llvm.org/), especially the GCC compatibility
section.

You may specify `--stl=stlport` to copy `libstlport` instead of the default
`libgnustl`. If you do so, and you wish to link against the shared library, you
must explicitly use `-lstlport_shared`. This requirement is similar to having to
use `-lgnustl_shared` for GNU `libstdc++`.

Similarly, you can specify `--stl=libc++` to copy the LLVM libc++ headers and
libraries. Unlike gnustl and stlport, you do not need to explicitly pass
`-lc++_shared` to use the shared library. The shared library will be used by
default unless building a static executable. To force the use of the static
library, pass `-static-libstdc++` when linking. This behavior matches that of a
normal host toolchain.

As mentioned in [C++ Library Support](cpp-support.html), you will often need to
pass `-latomic` when linking against libc++.

Note that if you omit the `--install-dir` option, the tool creates a tarball in
the current directory named `$TOOLCHAIN_NAME.tar.bz2`. The tarball can be placed
in a different directory by using `--package-dir`.

For more options and details, use `--help`.

### Unified Headers

Unified headers are the up to date platform headers that are shipped alongside
the deprecated headers in NDK r14:
https://android.googlesource.com/platform/ndk/+/master/docs/UnifiedHeaders.md

To use unified headers with standalone toolchains, pass `--unified-headers` when
creating your toolchain.

Note: Unified headers with standalone toolchains do not work as well for GCC.
See the [r14 changelog] for a list of issues.

Working with Clang
------------------

Clang binaries are automatically included in standalone toolchains created with
the new tool.

Note: Clang binaries are copied along with the GCC ones, because they rely on
the same assembler, linker, headers, libraries, and C++ STL implementation.

This operation also installs two wrapper scripts, named `clang` and `clang++`,
under `<install-dir>/bin`. These scripts invoke the `clang` binary with the
correct target architecture flags. In other words, they should work without any
modification, and you should be able to use them in your own builds by just
setting the `CC` and `CXX` environment variables to point to them.

### Clang targets with ARM

When building for ARM, Clang changes the target based on the presence of the
`-march=armv7-a` and/or `-mthumb` compiler flags:

**Table 2.** Specifiable `-march` values and their resulting targets.

| `-march` value                      | Resulting target                 |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `-march=armv7-a`                    | `armv7-none-linux-androideabi`   |
| `-mthumb`                           | `thumb-none-linux-androideabi`   |
| Both `-march=armv7-a` and `-mthumb` | `thumbv7-none-linux-androideabi` |

You may also override with your own `-target` if you wish.

`clang` and `clang++` should be drop-in replacements for `gcc` and `g++` in a
makefile. When in doubt, use the following options when invoking the compiler to
verify that they are working properly:

* `-v` to dump commands associated with compiler driver issues
* `-###` to dump command line options, including implicitly predefined ones.
* `-x c < /dev/null -dM -E` to dump predefined preprocessor definitions
* `-save-temps` to compare `*.i` or `*.ii` preprocessed files.

ABI Compatibility
-----------------

By default, an ARM Clang standalone toolchain will target the armeabi-v7a ABI.
GCC will target armeabi. Either can be controlled by passing the appropriate
`-march` flag, and Clang can also be controlled with `-target`.

To target armeabi-v7a with GCC, you must set the following flags when invoking
the compiler: `-march=armv7-a -mfloat-abi=softfp -mfpu=vfpv3-d16`.

The first flag targets the armv7 architecture. The second flag enables
hardware-FPU instructions while ensuring that the system passes floating-point
parameters in core registers, which is critical for ABI compatibility.

We recommend using the `-mthumb` compiler flag to force the generation of
16-bit Thumb-2 instructions (Thumb-1 for armeabi). If omitted, the toolchain
will emit 32-bit ARM instructions.

To use NEON instructions, you must use the `-mfpu` compiler flag: `-mfpu=neon`.

Note that this setting forces the use of `VFPv3-D32`, per the ARM specification.

Also, make sure to provide the following two flags to the linker:
`-march=armv7-a -Wl,--fix-cortex-a8`.

The first flag instructs the linker to pick toolchain libraries which are
tailored for armv7-a. The 2nd flag is required as a workaround for a CPU bug in
some Cortex-A8 implementations.

You don't have to use any specific compiler flag when targeting the other ABIs.

Warnings and Limitations
------------------------

### Windows support

The Windows binaries do not depend on Cygwin. This lack of dependency makes them
faster. The cost, however, is that they do not understand Cygwin path
specifications like `cygdrive/c/foo/bar`, as opposed to `C:/foo/bar`.

The NDK build system ensures that all paths passed to the compiler from Cygwin
are automatically translated, and manages other complexities, as well. If you
have a custom build system, you may need to resolve these complexities yourself.

### Exceptions, RTTI, and STL

The toolchain binaries support C++ exceptions and RTTI by default. To disable
C++ exceptions and RTTI when building sources (to generate lighter-weight
machine code, for example), use `-fno-exceptions` and `-fno-rtti`.

### C++ STL support

The standalone toolchain includes a copy of a C++ Standard Template Library
implementation. This implementation is either for GNU libstdc++, STLport, or
libc++, depending on what you specify for the `--stl=<name>` option [described
previously](#creating_the_toolchain). To use this implementation of STL, you
need to link your project with the proper library:

* Use `-static-libstdc++` when using libc++ for the static library version, or
  `-lstdc++` (implicit) to link against the static library version of any other
  implementation. Doing so ensures that all required C++ STL code is included
  into your final binary. This method is ideal if you are only generating a
  single shared library or executable.

  This is the method that we recommend.

* Alternatively, use `-lgnustl_shared` to link against the shared library
  version of GNU `libstdc++`. If you use this option, you must also make sure to
  package `libgnustl_shared.so` with your app in order for your code to load
  properly. Table 3 shows where this file is for each toolchain type.

  Note: GNU libstdc++ is licensed under the GPLv3 license, with a linking
  exception. If you cannot comply with its requirements, you cannot redistribute
  the shared library in your project.

* Use `-lstlport_shared` to link against the shared library version of STLport.
  When you do so, you need to make sure that you also package
  `libstlport_shared.so` with your app in order for your code to load properly.
  Table 3 shows where this file is for each toolchain:

* The shared library version of libc++ will be used by default. If you use this
  option, `libc++_shared.so` must be packaged with your app or your code will
  not load.  Table 3 shows where this file is for each architecture.

  **Table 3.** Specifiable `-march` values and their resulting targets.

  | Toolchain | Location                                 |
  | --------- | ---------------------------------------- |
  | arm       | `$TOOLCHAIN/arm-linux-androideabi/lib/`  |
  | arm64     | `$TOOLCHAIN/aarch64-linux-android/lib/`  |
  | mips      | `$TOOLCHAIN/mipsel-linux-android/lib/`   |
  | mips64    | `$TOOLCHAIN/mips64el-linux-android/lib/` |
  | x86       | `$TOOLCHAIN/i686-linux-android/lib/`     |
  | x86\_64   | `$TOOLCHAIN/x86_64-linux-android/lib/`   |

Note: If your project contains multiple shared libraries or executables, you
must link against a shared-library STL implementation.  Otherwise global state
in these libraries will not be unique, which can result in unpredictable runtime
behavior. This behavior may include crashes and failure to properly catch
exceptions.

The reason the shared version of the libraries is not simply called
`libstdc++.so` is that this name would conflict at runtime with the system's own
minimal C++ runtime. For this reason, the build system enforces a new name for
the GNU library. The static library does not have this problem.
